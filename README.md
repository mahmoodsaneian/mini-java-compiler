Overview
This project is a Mini-Java compiler developed using Java and ANTLR. It is designed to analyze, parse, and generate code for a simplified subset of Java. The compiler performs lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis while also supporting code generation.

Features
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes Mini-Java source code.
Parsing: Uses ANTLR to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Semantic Analysis: Type checking and validation.
Code Generation: Converts Mini-Java code into an intermediate or target language.
